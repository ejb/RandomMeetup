## Random meetup finder

This displays a random meetup (ie. interest group) based on the current or specified location. It may not work so well outside of large cities.

It's a quick bit of fun by [Elliot Bentley](http://elliotbentley.com/) and entirely unaffiliated with [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/), though it makes use of its API (thanks!).
